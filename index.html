    <h1>Important Notice</h1>
    <p>
        The LIAM2 project is <strong>DISCONTINUED</strong> and
        <strong>NO LONGER MAINTAINED</strong>. See below if you still need to
        consult the documentation or download the last release.
    </p>

    <h2>About LIAM2</h2>
    <p>
        LIAM2 is a tool to develop (different kinds of)
        <a href="https://liam2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html#about-microsimulation">microsimulation</a>
        models.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal of the project was to let modellers concentrate on what is
        strictly specific to their model without having to worry about the
        technical details.
        This was achieved by providing a generic microsimulation toolbox which
        is not tied to a particular model. By making it available for free, our
        hope was to greatly reduce the development costs (in terms of both time
        and money) of microsimulation models.
    </p>
    <p>
        The toolbox was made as generic as possible so that it could be used to
        develop almost any microsimulation model as long as it used
        cross-sectional ageing, i.e., all individuals are simulated at the same
        time for one period, then for the next period, etc.
